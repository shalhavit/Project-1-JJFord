Project 1: Developing a Project Container
=========

In this project, we're going to develop the skeleton of for a single-page app/site which will serve as an evolving template for course projects, inspired by [Apple's recent treatment of their new Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/).

### In class

In class, we're going to talk through the rough outline of how the skeleton is put together before turning to you to ask you to implement a few, additional features and add your own touches to it.  This means you'll need to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository (using the [github app](http://mac.github.com)), make changes, and push them to your fork so we can see what you've done.

As far as the specific changes we'd like you to make. . .

+ Animate the white waypoint buttons when you hover over them.

+ Record your own video and pull it into to replace [Beyonc√©'s "Countdown"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XY3AvVgDns).

+ Animate the entry of the detail panels--perhaps flying in or fading in or. . .--_a la_ [the Mac Pro example](https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/).

+ At the bottom of the page, you should notice a black arrow.  Make that arrow proceed between waypoints.
